      <h2>Model Site</h2>
      <p>I would like to model the layout of my site after the <a href="https://www.cbreptile.com/crested-gecko-breeder/"><img src="https://www.cbreptile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crested-gecko-breeders-1500x630.jpg" alt="cbreptile"></a> website. 
        I chose this site because CBREPTILE.COM is a well-organized and easy-to-navigate website that provides a wealth of information about geckos
        The site has a comprehensive guide to the different types of geckos, as well as information on gecko care, housing, and breeding.
        The site also has a forum where users can share information and ask questions.</p>
